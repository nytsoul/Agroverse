# AgroVerse
AgroVerse is a transparent agricultural supply chain platform leveraging blockchain (Arbitrum Sepolia), INR-denominated pricing, and Stripe for payments. It supports robust, role-based access for farmers, distributors, retailers, consumers, verifiers, and admins, with advanced dashboards and multi-language support.

## Key Features

- **On-Chain Batch Registry**: Produce batches are registered on-chain with INR pricing (whole rupees), ensuring transparency and traceability.
- **Stripe Payment Integration**: Off-chain payments are handled via Stripe, with INR-to-paise conversion and secure webhook verification.
- **Relayer-Based Ownership Transfer**: Only a relayer (verifier) can transfer batch ownership on-chain after payment confirmation.
- **Role-Based Authentication**: Six roles (farmer, distributor, retailer, consumer, verifier, admin) with protected routes and dedicated profile pages.
- **Batch Verification Lifecycle**: Batches move through unverified, pending, and verified states, managed by verifiers via a dashboard.
- **React Frontend (Vite + shadcn UI)**: Modern UI with reusable components, protected routes, and i18n (English, Hindi, Tamil, Odia).
- **Wagmi & MetaMask Integration**: Blockchain state and wallet connection managed via wagmi and React Query.
- **Express Backend**: Handles API endpoints, Stripe webhooks, and blockchain relayer operations.
- **Idempotent Webhook Handling**: Prevents duplicate ownership transfers on Stripe webhook retries.
- **Data Fetching & Caching**: Uses React Query for efficient data management and caching.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Multi-language support with persistent language preference across all dashboards, including admin/government oversight.
- **IoT Alerts & Weather Integration**: Components for weather alerts and IoT notifications for stakeholders.
- **QR Code Scanning**: QRScanner component for batch tracking and verification.
- **Soil & Crop Analysis**: SoilAnalyzer and CropPricePrediction modules for data-driven insights.
- **Robust Admin & Verifier Tools**: Redesigned dashboards for managing verification, batch status, and relayer setup, including:
  - Advanced batch search (case-insensitive, resilient to input errors)
  - Downloadable compliance reports with fallback/static PDF support
  - Modals for batch history and certificates
  - Live feed for real-time updates
  - Full i18n coverage
- **Testing & Simulation**: Includes test scripts for contract, webhook, and API simulation.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Architecture, API, and integration guides in the docs/ folder.

## 🎯 Key Features

### Blockchain & Supply Chain
- **INR-Only On-Chain Pricing**  
  Set farm-gate, distributor, and retailer prices in rupees—all stored on the blockchain.
- **Off-Chain Payments with Stripe**  
  Secure checkout and webhooks trigger ownership transfers.
- **Verifier-Based Transfers**  
  Only approved relayers can call `transferOwnershipByVerifier`.
- **Lean Reads & Fast UI**  
  Recent batches timeline with search, skeleton loaders, and detail modals.
- **Idempotent Webhooks**  
  Automatic duplicate-write protection (handles nonce errors).

### 📅 Expiry & Notifications
- **Use-By Date Tracking**  
  Farmers set an expiry date during registration. This date is stored on-chain and displayed across all dashboards (Distributor, Retailer, Consumer).
- **Automated Expiry Alerts**  
  A background cron job checks for batches nearing expiry and triggers an external n8n webhook.
- **WhatsApp Integration**  
  The n8n workflow sends WhatsApp notifications to stakeholders when their batches are about to expire.
- **Visual Indicators**  
  Red "Expires: [Date]" badges in the UI warn buyers of approaching expiry dates.

### 🌱 Supply Chain Features
- **Batch Splitting**  
  Buyers can purchase partial quantities, creating new "child" batches on-chain while preserving the "parent" batch's history.
- **Parent-Child Lineage**  
  Full traceability from the original farm batch down to the smallest consumer unit.
- **Historical Price Tracking**  
  Split batches inherit and preserve the price history (Farmer → Distributor → Retailer) of their parent batches.
- **Role-Based Dashboards**  
  Dedicated interfaces for Farmers, Distributors, Retailers, and Consumers with role-specific purchase and pricing logic.

### 🤖 ML-Powered Crop Price Prediction (NEW)
- **Random Forest Model**  
  Trained on historical Odisha agricultural data with 95%+ accuracy
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**  
  Predicts prices based on:
  - District and crop type
  - Soil quality (Grade A/B/C)
  - Rainfall patterns
  - Temperature variations
  - Seasonal trends
- **Real-Time Predictions**  
  Instant price forecasts for 30+ crop varieties across all Odisha districts
- **Interactive UI**  
  User-friendly interface with district selection, crop dropdown, and detailed predictions
- **Data-Driven Insights**  
  Helps farmers make informed decisions about crop selection and pricing

### 🗺️ Geo-Inference Mapping System (NEW)

  - **Farmer Layer**: 90 individual farmer markers (3 per district) with contact info
- **Smart Route Calculation**  
  - Automatic location detection with manual refinement
  - Real-time driving routes via OpenRouteService API
  - Routes follow actual roads with polyline visualization
  - Distance and travel time display (intelligently formatted)
- **Layer Toggle System**  
  Switch between crop regions and individual farmers with one click
- **Custom Icons**  
  - Distributor: Blue location pin
  - Farmers: Orange circles with 🌾 icon
  - Routes: Color-coded polylines (blue for farmers, red for regions)
- **Contact Integration**  
  Direct access to farmer contact information for logistics planning
- **Comprehensive Coverage**  
  All 30 Odisha districts with realistic farmer data and GPS coordinates

### ✅ Verifier UX & Workflow
- **Themed Verify Modal**  
  Verifiers get a themed dialog to confirm and enter a passkey before marking a batch as Verified.
- **Search & Sorting on Verifier Dashboard**  
  Quickly filter by `ID`, `crop`, or `holder` and sort by `ID`, `quantity`, or `crop` (asc/desc). Verified batches remain hidden.
- **One-way Verification Rules**  
  Verified items cannot be edited; only allowed transitions between `unverified` and `pending` before final verify.
- **i18n Coverage**  
  English, Tamil, Hindi, and Odia across Navigation, Hero, Login, Index, and Verifier flows.
- **O(1) Crop Image Lookup**  
  Instant image rendering for 30+ crop types using a hash map, replacing legacy conditional logic.

🛠️ Scripts

```jsonc
// package.json (root)
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "server:dev": "node server/src/index.js",
    "server": "node server/src/index.js"
  }
}

// server/package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "node --watch src/index.js",
    "start": "node src/index.js"
  }
}
```


⚠️ Troubleshooting

- **Webhook Signature Errors**  
  Ensure `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches your Stripe CLI/webhook config.
- **Contract Address Issues**  
  Verify `AGRI_TRUTH_CHAIN_ADDRESS` points to your deployed contract (not an EOA).
- **Relayer Setup**  
  Confirm `RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY` has sufficient Sepolia ETH.
- **Pricing Mismatch**  
  Stripe sends amounts in paise; contract stores rupees—convert appropriately.
- **Batch Search/Download Issues**  
  Admin dashboard batch search and download are robust, but ensure correct batch IDs and check for static PDF fallback if download fails.
- **Crop Prediction Not Working?**  
  Make sure the Python ML server is running (`python_server.py` in the `server` folder) for crop price prediction features.

🔒 Security & Data

- **On-Chain:** Public data (batch IDs, owners, INR prices)  
- **Off-Chain:** Minimal session & role data; Stripe handles payment details  
- **Idempotency:** Webhooks are idempotent to avoid duplicate blockchain writes
